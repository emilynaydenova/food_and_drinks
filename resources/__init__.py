"""
Flask-RESTful provides a Resource base class that can define
the routing for one or more HTTP methods for a given URL.
"resources" will be our classes which inherit from the Resource class
from flask_restfull.
They will define the behavior on GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
for different endpoints.
They will communicate with the managers, so that the application
can achieve its purpose.
